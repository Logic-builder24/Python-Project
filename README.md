🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Tuberculosis Data
This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global Tuberculosis (TB) statistics using data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The analysis uncovers trends, correlations, and key insights into TB prevalence, incidence, mortality, and case detection rates across various countries and regions.

📁 Project Structure
📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes TB indicators per 100,000 population, such as:

Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms)

Estimated incidence (all forms)

Estimated mortality (excluding HIV)

Case detection rate (%)

Source: World Health Organization (WHO)

🧪 Jupyter Notebook EDA
Summary statistics & null value checks

Correlation analysis

Visual exploration using:

Box plots

Heatmaps

Scatter plots

🌐 Dash Interactive Web App
Filter by year and WHO region

Real-time visualizations:

Bar charts

Scatter plots

Choropleth maps

Global summary cards

Export options: CSV, Excel, PDF

Mobile-responsive layout

🔍 Key Questions Explored
Which countries have the highest TB burden?

Is there a correlation between TB incidence and mortality?

How does the case detection rate vary by region?

Are there any outliers or unexpected trends?

📈 Visualizations
📊 Scatter Plots — Prevalence vs Mortality

🔥 Heatmaps — Correlation matrix

📉 Bar Charts — Top countries by TB indicators

📦 Box Plots — Regional distribution of metrics

🧪 Unmasking Tuberculosis: A Global Data Dive
Exploratory Data Analysis on Global TB Statistics

Welcome to a data-driven journey into one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases — Tuberculosis (TB). Using official data from the World Health Organization (WHO), this project explores global TB trends, unveils hidden correlations, and delivers interactive insights that matter.

Whether you're a data scientist, public health researcher, or simply a curious mind — this project has something for you.

🌍 Why This Project?
Despite being preventable and curable, TB still claims over a million lives annually. By analyzing global TB metrics, we aim to:

Identify countries and regions with the highest burden

Understand the relationship between detection and mortality

Highlight success stories and areas needing attention

Turn raw health data into powerful visual stories

📊 What's Inside?
